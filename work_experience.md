As a Research Collaborator specializing in Linguistics and Eye-Tracking Technology, I partnered Professor Anindita Sahoo from Indian Institute of Technology Madrasto support a study on Punjabi, an Indian language. My role involved providing extensive methodological assistance, encompassing the design of linguistically-focused experiments and training in the use of eye-tracking equipment. I contributed to the development of surveys, the collection and analysis of linguistic data, and offered insights specific to the nuances of Punjabi. This collaboration is ongoing, with plans to co-author a research paper that encapsulates our combined expertise and the novel findings of our study in language and eye-tracking technology. My involvement has been integral from the experimental phase through to the analytical and writing stages, ensuring a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of Punjabi language processing.As a Research Collaborator specializing in Linguistics and Eye-Tracking Technology, I partnered Professor Anindita Sahoo from Indian Institute of Technology Madrasto support a study on Punjabi, an Indian language.

In research-based language tutorials, I conducted weekly small-group online conversations, each lasting thirty minutes, for undergraduate students studying various languages. These sessions focused on topics that were both interesting and relevant to their studies. Utilising digital technology and learning platforms, along with email, I organised, coordinated, and delivered these communicative and conversational sessions. Additionally, I fostered a positive and relaxed online atmosphere, enabling students to practice and enhance their foreign language speaking abilities, an integral part of their Virtual Year Abroad program.In research-based language tutorials, I conducted weekly small-group online conversations, each lasting thirty minutes, for undergraduate students studying various languages.
